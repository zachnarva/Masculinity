<h1>final project: <strong>"How do you think and talk about masculinity?</strong></h1>

<p>This website was created as a tool, targeted directly to men, to instigate reflection on our society's strict gender roles. It specfically explores the ways in which masculinity is perceived as well as offers resources for further learning. This site is also a data collection tool. The embedded google survey will allow me to continue my research on perceptions of masculinity.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>My data processing took a non-traditional form. My main goal for this project was to create an accessible narrative that men could read without feeling judged. I did a phenomenal amount of reading and critical thinking to build the structure and gather the content for the site. For the survey, I looked through a collection of other surveys relating to masculinity and interview questions and assembled a list of questions that will hopefully be as thought provoking for users as it is useful for gathering data. Post-visualization analysis can only being, as I have not yet received responses to my survey, but from the feedback given to my by Joey and my cohort mates, I have compiled a resource that I hope will prove helpful to different audiences of individuals raised as men. </p>
